Evaluating the program that my group has created it is clear to see that we have been able to implement almost everything we have set out 
to create.  
+ The programmers have created a game using C++ and the Raylib graphics library. 
+ The group has also been able to implement a home screen with graphics, spaceships using graphics and enemy space ships with homemade 
graphics.  
+ This game also allows users to use enter to shoot their enemies and WASD keys to move their space ship. 
+The user can get to the game screen by going through the home screen. This has the graphics we created as well as a settings menu which 
allows the user to change the screen size.   
+ We have not been able to implement a device to control movement but that is something that will be added later on in the development.  
All together we have implemented all the functional and non functional requirements that we set out to create.  This is a secure game as it
is a functioning desktop application. Since it is not being moved into an internet application it is very secure.  All of the characters we
wanted to create are functional and have been implemented in the game.  This game meets the criteria we set forth to create and evaluates 
to be a solid program with not only skilled programming but unique design.
